# MTBToken Smart Contract
MTBToken is one of the Memes Tokens.

## Introduction
Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.

Solidity is a curly-bracket language. It is influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript, and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

## Why choose Binance Smart Chain
BSC is fully EVM compatible. It supports one of the most popular DeFi wallets – Metamask. Moreover, it has pre-integrated price oracles (e.g. ChainLink) which are very important for dApps of different types. With this kind of compatibility, it has become very easy for dapps owners to switch from Ethereum to Binance Smart Chain.

When DeFi coins soared in 2021, Ethereum transaction fees hit record highs. This became a bottleneck for DeFi growth and discouraged mass participation. In comparison to Ethereum, gas fees on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) are almost 20 times lower.

## Deploying the contract
Contracts deployed on a blockchain are immutable. This means that the address and the code of that Smart Contract can’t be modified since it’s permanently written on the blockchain.

The MTBToken smart contract was deployed in **Binance Smart Chain**(Testnet) in the address *0x89c2bc63d760e9ab6adb853b642a8165fbb75424*, you can check it in [bscscan](https://testnet.bscscan.com/token/0x89c2bc63d760e9ab6adb853b642a8165fbb75424#balances "bscscan").
